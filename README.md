# Final Project: Selection & Guidelines

For the final project in this class, you will have to code an original program that demonstrates the skills you have acquired in the course.

## THE CODE

The subject of this original program is entirely up to you, based on the Discussions you've had throughout the semester. However, it does need to show a certain degree of sophistication, demonstrating your proficiency over the material in the course. This means that the code should have at least the following elements:

* Adequate use of variables. Your variables must have the right type for the inputs and operations in which they are involved. When/If necessary, they must be cast to the correct types. Your variables' names must be descriptive enough to indicate their contents and use in the code.
* Branching. Your program should have branching options, and those options must show adequate use of conditions and all related operators. The use of the boolean library (bool.h) to store and reuse boolean values is optional, feel free to use it if it will make your program easier to code.
* Loops. Your program should make use of loops in some way, either to process data, or to present the user with menus and different options.
* Arrays. Your program should make use of arrays to store and process data. For the purpose of this requirement, using strings does not count as using arrays; however, using arrays of strings does.
* User-Defined Functions. You must implement at least 4 different user-defined functions, placed in at least one separate file from the main code file. These functions must be well-defined, carrying out a single general functionality. Your functions must show your proficiency over the various skills in this topic (Return types and values, pass-by-pointer, the #include directive). While the minimum is 4, I recommend making as many functions as needed, while keeping the functions as simple and short as possible.
* File Input and Output. Your program must read the contents of an existing text file and write data to a text file. It does not need to be something too sophisticated.
Additionally, there are two topics that are part of the course, but optional for the Final Project:
* Structs. I am making this optional, as in many applications, it can be hard to find a reason to use them. Feel free to implement them if they meet your needs!
* Pointers. Pointers is one of the most complex topics in C. They are hard to learn and to use properly. In this course, we barely cover the surface of what you can do with them. Hence, why it is not required, but if you can find a reason to use them, they are allowed.
 
Of course, there’s Extra Credit. For the extra credit, there are three main topics that are not part of the usual course but are part of the zyBooks material. These are covered in Chapters 10 and 11. Adding one of these to your code will net you 10 Extra Points in your project grade; adding two, 15 points; all of them, 20 total extra points. The topics are:

* Recursion.
* Sorting.
* Searching.

The final project will also include a rubric on code quality. Overall, your code must be:

* Well-structured. The order of the instructions is logical, and functionality is properly divided across multiple functions.
* Well-formatted. Code is properly indented; code blocks and sub-blocks are easily distinguishable.
* Commented. All functions have at least one comment describing their general use. Comments in the code help clarify its intended meaning.
THE REPORT
In addition to your code, you must provide a report with the following elements:
* A brief description of your project.
* If you use any external libraries, or if your code requires any special files, include them as Installation Instructions.
* How to use your code, once it is running. Think of it like the instructions you would give to someone who is using your program for the first time.
* An algorithm that describes how your code works. This should describe the processes that your code is intended to follow. You can write it as a series of steps, as a flow chart, or as pseudocode. Do note that the algorithm does not have to be identical to your submitted code -- there might be things you will not be able to include in your code.
* A small report of your experience working in this project: The challenges you encountered, how you solved them, and anything else you feel is missing from your code.
